Different projects are sorted in folders, i try to upload both .exe and the .py source files.
This is so that people who just want to try the project can just download and run the .exe,
and people who dont trust .exe files(rightfully so) can download the .py file, inspect it for "trouble" and then run it in python.(or compile it on their own)
